Assignment - Ira Javier - C15362901

My project will start off with a welcome screen and will ask the user to click in order to enter.
Once the user has clicked, it will start loading - will show a loading bar and then quickly direct
the user to the main screen. It will consist of 4 buttons, a graph showing some statistics, and a
slideshow of weapons with some description. When you hover over the buttons, it will show different
functions like:
1 - clock
2 - map
3 - scan
4 - fingerprint
